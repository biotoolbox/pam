Description: Library for processing Chl Fluorescence & P700 Absorbance data generated by WALZ hardware. Four models are provided for the regression of Pi curves, which can be compared with each other in order to select the most suitable model for the data set. Control plots ensure the successful verification of each regression. Bundled output of alpha, ETRmax, Ik etc. enables fast and reliable further processing of the data.
